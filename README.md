## Hi there 👋

I’m Michelle — a music-obsessed data analyst, studio-style practice at the intersection of **music, data, and AI**.

I explore how streaming, audience, and campaign data can support **labels, management, and artist teams** with clearer decisions, better storytelling, and simpler workflows.

### What I’m working on
- 🎧 **Music intelligence projects** — reports and dashboards that dig into artist performance, audience behavior, and release outcomes.  
- 📊 **Analytics & visualization** — turning messy metrics into clear, decision-ready views for strategy, reporting, and A&R support.  
- 🤖 **AI + workflow experiments** — exploring ways AI can help with discovery, insights, and reducing repetitive work for music teams.
